        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Farali pattice is an easy snack of patties made with potatoes and stuffed with a sweet filling of coconut, nuts and raisins. This dish is from the Gujarati cuisine that is made during fast or upvas. I often make these pattice during Navratri and also on regular days.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large potatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated coconut</li>
            <li>1/4 cup roasted peanuts</li>
            <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp red chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the potatoes until soft. Peel and mash them.</li>
            <li>In a pan, heat some oil and add cumin seeds. Once they splutter, add grated coconut, peanuts, raisins, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take a small portion of the mashed potato and flatten it in your palm. Place a spoonful of the coconut mixture in the center and fold the potato over it to form a patty.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan and fry the patties until golden brown on both sides.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with green chutney or ketchup.</li>
        </ol>
